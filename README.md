## Description
This repository houses The Daily Planner App, whihc is a browser-based tool designed to aid busy employees in effectively managing their schedules. By integrating advanced JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and third-party APIs, the app provides an intuitive platform for scheduling events. Powered by jQuery, it offers dynamic updates of HTML and CSS to ensure a seamless user experience.

Developed with user experience in mind, the app generates timeblocks for standard business hours, adapting as the user scrolls. These timeblocks are color-coded for instant recognition of past, present, and future events. Through jQuery, users can easily input event details, with data persistently stored in local storage to survive page refreshes.

The development process involved mastering the javaScript for precise date and time manipulation within the browser. This project emphasized the importance of effectively implementing external documentation. It honed skills in advanced JavaScript techniques and demonstrated jQuery's prowess in dynamic content updates and user interaction. The Daily Planner App stands as a testament to creating practical applications by blending diverse technologies to deliver a user-centered solution.
